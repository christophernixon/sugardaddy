    ```
- [ ] __Add logging:__

    A line graph, with a line for each member of the conversation (minimum 2), y-axis reply length, x-axis time since conversation start. [Example.](https://python-graph-gallery.com/124-spaghetti-plot/)
- [ ] __Graph: Sentiment against time:__
    Bubble-plot, sentiment on one axis ranging from positive to negative, time on other ranging from start to end of a week, size of bubbles represents message length.
